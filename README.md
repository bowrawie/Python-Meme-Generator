# Python-Meme-Generator
###### Python script to train on drag and drop and Image manipulating.


## How to use : 
```
  Drag a picture to the file and wait.
```
***Example :***
```
  Example1.jpg is the picture before.
  Dragging to the file will result in cringe.png.
```

***PS :***
Definetly *NSFW*.<br>
Use it at your own cost, you can change the text and all the variables to make it *SFW* but initially it is not.
>install impact.ttf for the font if you do not have it.
